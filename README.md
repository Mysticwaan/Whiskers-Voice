## Tools & Methods Used for Analysis  

1. **Audio Recording:** High-quality microphones and pre-recorded audio samples were used to capture feline vocalizations.  
2. **Spectrogram Visualization:** Audacity was employed to generate spectrograms that visualize the frequency distribution of vocalizations over time.  
3. **Feature Extraction:** Acoustic features such as pitch, loudness, and duration were extracted using the Librosa library.  
4. **Machine Learning:** A K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm was utilized to classify the vocalizations based on the extracted features.  
5. **Visualization:** Matplotlib was used to create visualizations that provided insights into both the dataset and the machine learning model's performance.
